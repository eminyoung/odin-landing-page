# odin-landing-page
Landing Page project from the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.

While working on this project, I utilized html to create the overall layout of the website. With html, I included images, buttons that link to external sites, and texts. 

With css, I was able to stylize the website including the buttons, links, and overall layout. Additionally, I used the flexbox properties to make the website more responsive and create a more efficient format for the website.
